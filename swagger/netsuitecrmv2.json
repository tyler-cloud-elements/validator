By default, any autonumbering of opportunity records is allowed to be overridden. However, if you are explicitly setting a value for tranID and that value is NOT being set in the system, you may have the &#xfffd;Allow Override&#xfffd; disabled. To enable overriding of autonumbering, go to Set Up > Company > Set up Auto-Generated Numbers > Transactions tab. Then check Allow Override in the Opportunity row and click Save.",
